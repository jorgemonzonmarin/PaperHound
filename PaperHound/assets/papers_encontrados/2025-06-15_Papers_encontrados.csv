Current ground-based propellant mass gauging technologies have become relatively mature, with diverse methods, high measurement accuracy, and assured reliability and safety. However, in spacecraft on-orbit measurements, the accuracy of commonly used ground-based methods decreases due to limitations in techniques for determining the gas–liquid interface position. This paper proposes a gas–liquid distribution reconstruction method based on ultrasonic tomography for spacecraft tank measurement scenarios. It investigates the priority back projection method, elliptical reflection method, and local curvature reconstruction method for gas–liquid interface based on transmitted signals, elliptical reflection signals, and echo signals, respectively. The image is processed based on the prior characteristics of the gas–liquid distribution material field, with the introduction of morphological image processing methods. Both intrusive and non-intrusive measurement experiments were conducted for validation. For intrusive experiments, the mean area estimation error in the gas domain is approximately 8.52%, with a positioning error of approximately 1.88 mm; and for non-intrusive experiments, the mean area estimation error is approximately 6.51%, with a positioning error of approximately 3.87 mm."

However, the conventional bulk PZT ultrasonic transducers currently employed for bubble detection are characterized by their large size and limited integration capabilities with integrated circuits (ICs). This constrains their application for real-time and long-term monitoring in small-diameter pipes. This study highlights the potential of piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducers (PMUTs) for real-time bubble detection in small pipes based on the principle of acoustic energy attenuation. The operating frequency of PMUTs has been theoretically optimized to enhance the performance of bubble sensing. Our fabricated PMUTs chips successfully measured bubbles in water, indicating an excellent linear relationship between the received voltages and bubble diameters within the 1-5 mm. Additionally, subsequent research indicates that environmental conditions, including temperature and flow medium types, have negligible impact on the bubble measurement. These results demonstrate the robustness of MUTs-based ultrasonic bubble detection techniques."

However, operating under self-generating-self-receiving (SGSR) method usually results in poor sensitivity. But the sensitivity cannot be improved simply by increasing the resonant frequency since the frequency of a specific kind of CMUT is designed for specific usage. In this paper, based on one specific type of CMUT, mechanical model is built and simulation analysis is demonstrated. A brand-new method one-generating-multiple-receiving (OGMR) is introduced and a special circuit model has been designed to improve the signal to thermal noise ratio. By increasing the number of receiving capacitors from 1 to 8, we increased the signal-noise ratio to 2.83 times. "

Among flexible and wearable pressure sensors, capacitive pressure sensors show significant advantages, owing to their potential low cost, ultra-low power consumption, tolerance to temperature variations, high sensitivity, and low hysteresis. In this work, we develop capacitive flexible pressure sensors using graphene based conductive foams. In these soft and porous conductive foams, graphene is present either as a coating of the pores in the foam, inside the structure of the foam itself, or a combination of both. We demonstrate that they are durable and sensitive at low pressure ranges (<10 kPa). Systematic analysis of the different pressure sensors revealed that the porous foams with graphene coated pores are the most sensitive (~ 0.137/kPa) in the pressure range 0-6kPa. Additionally, we achieved very low limit of detection of 0.14 Pa, which is one of the lowest values reported. Further, we demonstrated the potential applications of our pressure sensors by showing detection of weak physiological signals of the body.

To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete. R. Buckminster Fuller, www.azquotes.com Antibubbles Antibubbles, which have sometimes been referred to as negative bubbles or inverted bubbles, have been known for at least 70 years. They were first reported in 1931/2 by Katalinic (1) and Hughes and Hughes (2) and originally considered as a scientific curiosity. Essentially, the structure of an antibubble consists of a thin shell or core of air which is separated by liquids, with the surfactant adsorbed at the inner and outer interfaces of the shell. The polar heads of the chemical surfactant are immersed in the aqueous medium, while the nonpolar tails face and extend into the gas. This is the exact opposite situation to a bubble where the thin shell of liquid separates the air inside and outside the bubble. The shell of air on the antibubble is about 10 nm thick and can generate interference colors. Antibubbles are formed at surfactant concentrations below and above the CMC, and several different types of surfactants have been used in their preparation. Dishwashing detergents were often used in the generation process, but more recently they have been prepared using different types of conventional long-chain nonionic, anion and protein (beer) surfactants (3). It is also interesting to note that antibubbles can be generated and stabilized by partially hydrophobic particles (4). Most studies in antibubbles have been mainly concerned with generation rather than stability. In Fig. 12.1, the structure of a common bubble is compared with chemically stabilized antibubbles and particle-stabilized antibubbles. In recent years, several interesting applications have been put forward. For example, it has been suggested that they can be used as antifoams or new types of lubricants analogous to ball bearings or filtration systems in which the web of passageways would be permeable to gas molecules (5). Since antibubbles provide twice the surface area of ordinary bubbles of the same size, another potential application could be the control of chemical reactions. It has also been shown that it is possible to replace air in the antibubble inner shell with other liquids or dyes, suggesting that they could be used as a drug delivery system."

The topological structure with three-phase percolative nano-nanonetworks produces synergistic effects of space charge enhancement and local electric field modulation, and it gives rise to an ultrahigh dielectric permittivity (113.4, at 1 kHz, over 1500% enhancement than that of commercial elastic polyurethane matrix) and excellent comprehensive electromechanical performance, and the optimal comprehensive electromechanical performance reaches to 542.91 MPa-1, which is over 9-fold than that of commercial polyurethane elastic film. An interdigital capacitive strain sensor is designed using the topological structured elastic dielectric nanocomposite. It possesses high initial capacitance density and positive capacitance response with stain, achieving high signal-to-noise ratio, high capacitance response sensitivity, and wide linear range, and it breaks through disadvantages of negative sensitivity and narrow linear range for conventional interdigital strain sensors.

(zapatopi.net/kelvin/quotes). Introduction Several non-intrusive analytical techniques have been used to provide information on bubble size distributions, gas fraction, texture and general characteristics of foams. Some of these are relatively simple optical methods, but with the application of image and video analysis, the changes in bubble size and texture of 2D foams can be fairly easily studied during ageing. This information can be useful, but since the rate of deterioration of a wet foam depends on the kinetics of coalescence, drainage and gas diffusion, it is sometimes difficult to separate these events and to resolve the main destabilization mechanism. Bisperink and coworkers (1) reviewed how the variation in 2D bubble size distribution in aging foams may be related to drainage, coalescence and the disproportionation process. Although microscopy can be conveniently used to study 2D foams, more complex techniques based on tomography have been applied to probe the interior and to measure bubble size distribution on 3D foams. The processing of the data usually involves three steps: image acquisition, image processing and data extraction. 3D imaging techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI) or X-ray computerized tomography can be used to develop a scale model in a computer memory. Based on these models the relationship between physical properties and the structure of solid foams can be established. UV, NMR and ultrasonic reflection methods have also been used, but overall it is still difficult to characterize bubble size and liquid fraction in real 3D foams, and hence most investigations are carried on quasi-2D foams. Although wet foams are unstable, the kinetics of breakdown can range from seconds to weeks, and this has resulted in the development of many different types of test methods for measuring foam stability. Overall, stability tests may be broadly classified as (a) dynamic tests, which measure the height or volume of the foam in a state of dynamic equilibrium between formation and decay, and (b) static tests, in which the rate of foam formation is zero (the gas flow into the liquid is eliminated) and the foam is allowed to collapse."
