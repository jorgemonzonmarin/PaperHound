Commonly used ultrasonic transducers have a small detection range and low sensitivity due to the diffraction of sound waves. Focused transducers are used to improve detection sensitivity. Unfortunately, focused transducers have narrow depth of field. Here, we developed a Bessel ultrasonic transducer for large depth of field by using conical acoustic lens. An acoustic lens is attached to a unfocused ultrasonic. And the acoustic lens is a cuboid prism with a concave cone on the bottom, made of fused silica. Similar to an axicon that can generate a Bessel beam, the Bessel ultrasonic transducer can produce nondiffracting Bessel ultrasonic beams. Therefore, extended depth of field with uniformly high resolution and high detection sensitivity can be obtained. We used COMSOL to simulate the transmission of ultrasonic field of the designed conical acoustic lens, and compare it with the spherical focused ultrasonic transducer. The results show that the depth of field of the Bessel ultrasonic transducer is about 8 times that of the conventional spherical focused ultrasonic transducer. And the depth of field of the Bessel ultrasonic transducer can be further adjusted by adjusting the cone angle of the conical acoustic lens. The Bessel ultrasonic transducer will help improve the capabilities of the ultrasound probe and expand its application range. For example, an ultrasonic probe with a large depth of field will expand the imaging depth of photoacoustic microscopy and enhance its ability in non-destructive testing. "

The experiments have been carried out at the high-intensity, white-beam facility of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, Germany, using an multi-frame, time-resolved detector developed for fast neutron resonance radiography. The results were however not fully optimal and therefore we have decided to modify the detector and optimize it for the given application, which is described in the present work. Furthermore, we managed to improve the image post-processing methodology and the noise suppression. Using the tailored detector and the improved post-processing significant increase in the image quality and an order of magnitude lower exposure times, down to 3.33 ms, have been achieved with minimized motion artifacts. Similar to the previous study, different two-phase flow regimes such as bubbly slug and churn flows have been examined. The enhanced imaging quality enables an improved prediction of two-phase flow parameters like the instantaneous volumetric gas fraction, bubble size and bubble velocities. Instantaneous velocity fields around the gas enclosures can also be more robustly predicted using optical flow methods as previously. "

Among flexible and wearable pressure sensors, capacitive pressure sensors show significant advantages, owing to their potential low cost, ultra-low power consumption, tolerance to temperature variations, high sensitivity, and low hysteresis. In this work, we develop capacitive flexible pressure sensors using graphene based conductive foams. In these soft and porous conductive foams, graphene is present either as a coating of the pores in the foam, inside the structure of the foam itself, or a combination of both. We demonstrate that they are durable and sensitive at low pressure ranges (<10 kPa). Systematic analysis of the different pressure sensors revealed that the porous foams with graphene coated pores are the most sensitive (~ 0.137/kPa) in the pressure range 0-6kPa. Additionally, we achieved very low limit of detection of 0.14 Pa, which is one of the lowest values reported. Further, we demonstrated the potential applications of our pressure sensors by showing detection of weak physiological signals of the body. Our work is highly relevant for research in flexible pressure sensors based on conductive foams as it shows the impact of different ways of incorporating conductive material on performance of pressure sensors.

Stretchable functional materials are important components of strain sensors, and they are still major challenges for high performance strain sensors. Herein, we demonstrate a novel strategy of designing and optimizing flexible strain sensor by developing topological structure modulated high permittivity elastic nanocomposite. The topological structure with three-phase percolative nano-nanonetworks produces synergistic effects of space charge enhancement and local electric field modulation, and it gives rise to an ultrahigh dielectric permittivity (113.4, at 1 kHz, over 1500% enhancement than that of commercial elastic polyurethane matrix) and excellent comprehensive electromechanical performance, and the optimal comprehensive electromechanical performance reaches to 542.91 MPa-1, which is over 9-fold than that of commercial polyurethane elastic film. An interdigital capacitive strain sensor is designed using the topological structured elastic dielectric nanocomposite. It possesses high initial capacitance density and positive capacitance response with stain, achieving high signal-to-noise ratio, high capacitance response sensitivity, and wide linear range, and it breaks through disadvantages of negative sensitivity and narrow linear range for conventional interdigital strain sensors. The prepared integrated strain sensor arrays are able to measure local strain of convoluted surfaces and monitor the motion of soft actuators in real time, and they would make conditions for intelligent control systems and the study of morphological intelligence.

Recently there has been a renewed interest in a third class of techniques that we term as single bubble/drop tests, which employ isolated whole bubbles and drops to probe the characteristics of foams and emulsions. Single bubble and drop techniques provide a convenient framework for investigating a number of important characteristics of foams and emulsions, including the rheology, stabilization mechanisms, and rupture dynamics. In this review we provide a comprehensive discussion of the various single bubble/drop platforms and the associated experimental measurement protocols including the construction of coalescence time distributions, visualization of the thin film profiles and characterization of the interfacial rheological properties. Subsequently, we summarize the recent developments in foam and emulsion science with a focus on the results obtained through single bubble/drop techniques. We conclude the review by presenting important venues for future research. "
